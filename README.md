## Division of work:
 - Kateryna Kovalchuk: Huffman's algorithm, report
 - Denis Humeniuk: LZW and LZ77 algorithms

##Conclusion:

All three algorithms are information compression algorithms, which are used to compress files so that they take up less memory and can be conveniently forwarded or stored.
Obviously, these algorithms will work very efficiently on small files, but they also do not lose in the speed of compression of large files. These algorithms work as quickly as possible on repetitive data with certain patterns. A more detailed study of the speed of operation of these algorithms can be found in the files lz77.ipynb, lzw.ipynb, huffman.ipynb
